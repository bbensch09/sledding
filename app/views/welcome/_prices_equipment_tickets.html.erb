      <h3 class="text-warning">Due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the sled hill will have a max capacity of <%=SLEDHILL_CAPACITY %> active sledders. As such, we will be holding 4 daily sledding sessions of 1.5hrs each on the main sled hill. The upper overflow sled hill will remain open throughout the day for any ticketholder. Please select your preferred time slot at the time of purchase, which guarantees that you will be able to enter the main sled hill at that time. If the main sled hill is not at capacity, ticket holders for other time slots will be permitted to enter the main area, until capacity is reached. </h3>
