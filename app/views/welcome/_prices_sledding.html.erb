        In order to speed up your check in and ensure your space in a session, we encourage you to purchase sledding tickets online in advance of your visit.
        <!-- We will have a limited capacity of lift tickets sold each day in order to spread out the crowd and keep the community safe. We therefore HIGHLY recommend booking online in advance. -->
      </h3>
<!--       <h3 class="text-warning">
        We offer a choice of 90 minute daily sledding sessions to spread out the crowd and allow more guests the opportunity to sled. After each session, we typically "Zamboni" the hill to ensure that all sledders begin their session with a freshly groomed surface perfect for sledding.
